# Sortable

Sortable is a project using an API to sort all the data provided from this one.
This data are precius because we are super-vilain and want detroy all the super-heroes like in My Hero Academia.

## How is working

To start we retrieve the data from the API to send them in an array. When we activate a filter we recover the data again but only the necessary of this one for sort in alphabetic or numeric order and then send them in a second array to compare them with what we have already sort.
Another important point, the data is preloaded to optimize loading.
